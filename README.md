# Deployment-E-commerce

## **Milestone 1: Project Introduction**

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on building a fully operational e-commerce platform using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The front-end will be developed with React’s Create React App (CRA), MongoDB will serve as the database, and Node.js with Express will manage back-end server functionality.

The project will be divided into two major sections: **Frontend** and **Backend** development.

- **Frontend:** Various user-facing pages will be created, including:
  - Login Page
  - Sign Up Page
  - Forgot Password Page
  - Home Page
  - Product Listing Page
  - Cart Page
  - Address Form Page
  - Payment Page
  - Order Confirmation Page
  - Order History Page
  - Product Details Page

- **Backend:** The server will manage data operations with MongoDB using Mongoose for schema consistency. API endpoints will handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through HTTP methods like `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

We will use **bcrypt** to hash user passwords for added security, and the project structure will prioritize scalability and maintainability.
